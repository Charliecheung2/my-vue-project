  The very first project and inmature project I make, a market-look H5 page. It contains a home page, a shopping cart(uses vuex to manage the global variables. And a goods list, goods detail page.

## Using Vue.js as front-end javascript framework
  First, run 'npm install' to download the dependencies that was written in the package.json file, it will start to download all the dependencies into a folder called node_modules.
  Then run 'npm run dev' or other command line you decide in the package.json file, it will start the pre-set, use the webpack tool and other plugins to help with the developing, such as hot reload. Any changes, just save it and you can start to see the changes you made.
  Finally after the all the works done and bug fixed, run the 'npm run build' to let the webpack tool to compack the files into tradictional JS, HTML, CSS files. Deploy the dist folder in the server container you use.
